## Included files

1. Week 2 Supervised Learning.html
	- HTML rendering of the Jupyter Notebook used for this session.
2. Week 2-SupervisedLearning.pdf
	- Session slides. Key concepts include types of algorithms such as decision trees, linear regression, and support vector machines, and practical implementation of these techniques using Scikit-Learn.
3. 2023_week2_supervisedLearning.zip
	- Zip file containing session materials.
4. Week 2 Supervised Learning.ipynb
	- Included in the zip file. Introduction to supervised learning methods in machine learning. Includes demonstrations of performance evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score for classification tasks.
5. k-folds.png
	- Included in the zip file, in the 'images' directory. demonstrates the k-fold cross-validation process in machine learning, where the dataset is split into several "folds" to train and validate a model multiple times. Used in the session Jupyter Notebook, see section 3 on cross-validation.
6. housing.csv
	- Included in the zip file, in the 'data' directory. The dataset is available through the Python *scikit-learn* library and from https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/. Please see dataset citation, below.
7. titanic.csv
	- Included in the zip file, in the 'data' directory. Data about passengers aboard the Titanic, originally from the report of the British Board of Trade in 1912. Provenance of this version unknown. R package cited below based on visual comparison.
