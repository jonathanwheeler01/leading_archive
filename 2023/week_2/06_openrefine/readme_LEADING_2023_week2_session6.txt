Information about the 2023 LEADING boot camp session on using OpenRefine to clean data. Topics addressed include 

* Inspecting data through faceting, filtering, and clustering.
* Data cleaning and transformation.

This asynchronous session was presented as a series of short videos, each of which was a walk-through of a section of the Library Carpentry OpenRefine lesson (<https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/>). Videos were recorded by Jon Wheeler, Data Curation Librarian at the University of New Mexico. No changes were otherwise made to the Library Carpentry lesson, which was presented as-is.
