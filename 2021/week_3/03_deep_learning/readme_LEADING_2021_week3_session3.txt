	- Zip file of session materials.
4. Week 3-Wednesday-session1 Deep Learning.ipynb
	- Included in the zip file. A hands-on introduction to deep learning, focusing on setting up the environment by importing essential libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization. The demonstration uses a dataset available from the Keras package. Dataset citation below.
