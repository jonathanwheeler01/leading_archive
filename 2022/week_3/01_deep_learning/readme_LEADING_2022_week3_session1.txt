## Included files

1. Week 3-DeepLearning.pdf
	- This slide deck provides an overview of deep learning, focusing on the architecture and functionality of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly Perceptrons and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), with explanations of their applications, limitations, and implementation examples.
2. Week 3-Deep Learning.html
	- HTML rendering of the Jupyter Notebook used in the session.
3. Week 3-Deep Learning.zip
	- Zip file of session materials.
4. Week 3-Deep Learning.ipynb
	- Included in the zip file. A hands-on introduction to deep learning, focusing on setting up the environment by importing essential libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization. The demonstration uses a dataset available from the Keras package. Dataset citation below.
5. my_keras_model.h5
	- Included in the zip file. A Keras model file, containing a pre-trained deep learning model, including its architecture, weights, and configuration.
6. my_keras_weights.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001
	- Included in the zip file. A TensorFlow or Keras checkpoint, which stores the weights of a trained model.
7. my_keras_weights.ckpt.index
	- Included in the zip file. An index file associated with a TensorFlow or Keras model checkpoint. It contains metadata about the model's saved weights, including pointers to the actual data stored in the accompanying .data files.
8. checkpoint
	- Included in the zip file. A metadata file used by TensorFlow or Keras.
9. MultipleInputs.png
	- Included in the zip file, in the 'images' directory. Input diagram included in the session Jupyter Notebook.
10. WideDeepNeuralNetwork.png
	- Included in the zip file, in the 'images' directory. Input diagram included in the session Jupyter Notebook.
