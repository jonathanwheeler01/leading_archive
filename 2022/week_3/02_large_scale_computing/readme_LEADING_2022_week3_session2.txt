# LEADING Boot Camp 2022, Week 3 Session 2

**Large-Scale Data Intensive Computing**

This directory contains files and content related to the asynchronous 2023 LEADING boot camp session on big data. Topics addressed include 

* Big data volumes and velocity.
* Data-intensive processing and parallel computing.
* Spark Machine Learning libraries (MLlib) with Python (PySpark).


## Included files

1. BigDataExercise.html
	- HTML rendering of the Jupyter Notebook for the session.
2. BigDataExercise.ipynb
	- Jupyter Notebook for the session. Provides a step-by-step guide on setting up PySpark within Google Colab, including accessing Google Drive and running initial tests, to demonstrate how to work with large datasets using PySpark in a cloud environment.
3. BigDataLecture.slides.html
	- Slide deck for the session. Introduces fundamental concepts in big data, covering tools, frameworks, and methodologies for processing and analyzing large datasets, often using distributed systems like Hadoop or Spark, while also discussing best practices and challenges in managing big data environments.
4. iris.csv
	- Dataset used to demonstrate Spark structured data processing in the session Jupyter Notebook. The dataset is included in the R base package and in the Python scikit-learn package. The data from UC Irvine and the source article (Fisher, 1936) are cited below.
5. test.txt.zip
	- Small zip file used to demonstrate unzipping a file within Colab in the Jupyter Notebook.
